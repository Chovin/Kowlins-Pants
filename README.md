# Kowlin's Pants
Playing around with [PICO-8](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)
If you don't have it, get it already!

^ That's the actual game, not just an image.  
If you have a pico-8, you can download the `png` and load the cartridge.  
If not, you can play the [web version](https://chovin.github.io/Kowlins-Pants/) (the 2 might not be in the same stages of development)
